    <h2>1. Goggles</h2>
    <p>Goggles protect your eyes from chlorine and let you see clearly underwater. Look for a pair that fits snugly but comfortably without leaking.</p>

    <h2>2. Swim Cap</h2>
    <p>Swim caps keep hair out of your face and help you move faster through the water. Silicone caps are durable and great for beginners.</p>

    <h2>3. Kickboard</h2>
    <p>A kickboard helps you focus on your leg strength and flutter kick. It’s a great way to build endurance while keeping balance in the pool.</p>

    <h2>4. Pull Buoy</h2>
    <p>Placed between your thighs, this foam tool keeps your legs afloat so you can focus on arm technique and breathing patterns.</p>

    <h2>5. Swim Fins</h2>
    <p>Fins add resistance to your kicks, building leg power and improving ankle flexibility. Short fins are best for training control and rhythm.</p>

    <h2>6. Water Bottle & Towel</h2>
    <p>Hydration and comfort matter. Keep water and a towel nearby — swimming burns energy fast, and staying hydrated helps your recovery.</p>

    <h2>7. Confidence</h2>
    <p>Every swimmer starts somewhere. With consistent practice and a positive mindset, you’ll go from nervous to natural in no time!</p>
