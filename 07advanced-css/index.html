    <h2>Why Swimming Matters</h2>
    <p>People of all ages can take advantage of swimming and learn to clear the mind through swimming, easing away overthinking and daily stress.</p>
    <p>Swimming can be a source of fun and a way to exercise your body, relieve stress, and clear your mind to bring it to peace.</p>
    <h2>History of Swimming</h2>
    <p>The history behind swimming goes back to the very 
      beginning of humanity. It has been a way to get 
      everything from food to exercise, keeping the body 
      and mind in healthy shape for long lives. Records 
      show swimming was practiced as far back as 2500 BCE. 
      It was used for leisure in Egypt and for military and 
      education in Greece and Rome.</p>
